ABSTRACT:
Secure retrieval of remote sensing images in an outsourced cloud environment garners 
considerable attention. Since the cloud service provider (CSP) is considered as a semi 
trusted third party that may return incorrect retrieval results to save computational 
resources or defraud retrieval fees for profit, it becomes a critical challenge to achieve 
secure and verifiable remote sensing image retrieval. This article presents a secure 
retrieval and blockchain-assisted verifiable scheme for encrypted remote sensing images 
in the cloud environment. In response to the characteristic that geographical objects in 
remote sensing images with clear category attributes, we design a remote sensing image 
retrieval method to facilitate secure and efficient retrieval. In addition, we propose a 
verifiable method combined with blockchain and Merkle trees for checking the integrity 
and correctness of the storage and retrieval services provided by CSP, which can replace 
the traditional third-party auditor. The security analysis and experimental evaluation 
demonstrate the security, verifiability, and feasibility of the proposed scheme, achieving 
secure remote sensing image retrieval while preventing malicious behavior of CSP.
