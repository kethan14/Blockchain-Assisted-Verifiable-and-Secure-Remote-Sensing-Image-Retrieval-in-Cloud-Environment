1.INTRODUCTION
1.1 OVERVIEW
The exponential growth of remote sensing images to petabyte levels due to the proliferation
of satellites presents significant challenges for users in managing storage and processing
resources. To cope with these challenges, many usersturn to Cloud Service Providers (CSPs)
for outsourced solutions, including storage and content-based retrieval services. However,
entrusting sensitive image data to CSPsraises concerns regarding data security and integrity.
Security risks associated with outsourcing sensitive remote sensing data to CSPs include the
potential for unauthorized access and data leaks. Encryption is commonly used to protect
data confidentiality before outsourcing it to CSPs. While encryption secures data from
unauthorized access, it poses challenges in ensuring the correctness of storage and retrieval
services provided by CSPs, leading to potential risks of incomplete or incorrect retrieval
results. Traditional solutions, such as third-party auditors (TPAs), have been employed to
verify CSP services, but they bring their own set of challenges, including trustworthiness
and the risk of collusion with CSPs, undermining the integrity of verification reports.
Blockchain technology emerges as a promising solution to address these challenges by
providing a decentralized, tamper-resistant ledger that ensures the integrity, reliability, and
verifiability of on-chain data. By leveraging blockchain, users can mitigate the risk of
malicious behaviour from CSPs or collusion between CSPs and TPAs. However, current
blockchain architectures face limitations in accommodating existing verification methods,
necessitating further research to overcome these constraints and ensure comprehensive
integrity in remote sensing image retrieval.
1.2 SCOPE OF THE PROJECT
The project focuses on addressing the security and reliability challenges associated with
remote sensing image retrieval in cloud environments. With the proliferation of satellite data
leading to petabyte-level storage demands, users increasingly rely on cloud service providers
(CSPs) for image storage and retrieval. However, concerns arise regarding the potential
unauthorized access and manipulation of sensitive image data by semi trusted CSPs. To
mitigate these risks, the project explores the integration of blockchain technology,
leveraging its decentralized and tamper-resistant nature to ensure data integrity, reliability,
and verifiability.

By emphasizing the importance of both data integrity and the correctness of retrieval
services, the project aims to develop a robust solution that enables secure and efficient
remote sensing image retrieval while safeguarding against potential malicious behaviour
from CSPs and third-party auditors.
1.3 PROBLEM STATEMENT
The sheer volume and variety of remote sensing images strain users' storage and processing
capabilities, necessitating reliance on cloud service providers (CSPs) for outsourced
solutions and content-based retrieval. However, this reliance raises concerns regarding data
security and integrity. The sensitive nature of remote sensing data, including geographic
locations and resource distribution patterns, exposes users to the risk of unauthorized access
and data leaks. Encryption serves as a primary means of protecting data confidentiality;
however, ensuring the correctness of storage and retrieval services in encrypted
environments remains a challenge. Without visibility into encrypted data, users face the
prospect of incomplete or erroneous retrieval results from CSPs, stemming from factors such
as resource optimization or fraudulent practices.
1.4 OBJECTIVE
Fortunately, blockchain technology offers a promising avenue for addressing the verification
of data integrity and service correctness in remote sensing image retrieval. As a
decentralized, tamper-resistant, and traceable distributed ledger, blockchain technology
ensures the trustworthiness of on-chain data. Each participating full node collaborates to
maintain data integrity through replication, while the data structure of chained hashing and
consensus algorithms safeguards against arbitrary data manipulation. Leveraging blockchain
technology, users can mitigate the risk of malicious behaviour from CSPs and collusion
between CSPs and third-party auditors (TPAs), thereby enhancing the integrity and
reliability of remote sensing image retrieval services.
