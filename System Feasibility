1. SYSTEM FEASIBILITY
1.1 Introduction
During the retrieval phase, the user initiates the process by submitting a retrieval request to
the cloud server. Upon validation of the request, the cloud server notifies the key
management system to distribute the necessary encryption keys. Subsequently, the cloud
server measures the similarity distances between the requested features and the features of
encrypted images stored in its database. Based on these distances, the cloud server selects
similar encrypted images to be sent back to the user. Meanwhile, it constructs a Merkle hash
tree using the distance results and generates a root hash representing the integrity of the
retrieval process. This root hash is then uploaded onto the blockchain, committing to the
completion of the retrieval service. In case the user doubts the returned images' similarity,
they can submit a challenge-based request to the blockchain. The smart contract on the
blockchain verifies the retrieval results using the challenge set submitted by the user,
providing a verification result that proves the correctness of the retrieval service provided
by the cloud server. This integrated process ensures transparency and accountability in the
retrieval service while maintaining data security and integrity.
PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATION: The preliminary investigation phase marks the
inception of the project development process, focusing on three key activities: Request
Clarification, Feasibility Study, and Request Approval.
REQUEST CLARIFICATION: Upon receiving approval from the organization and project
guide, the project request undergoes thorough examination to ascertain the precise
requirements of the system. The proposed project aims to design a mail-enabled platform
tailored for a small firm, facilitating seamless communication through message sending and
receiving functionalities, incorporating a search engine, address book, and entertaining
games. Designed for users interconnected via the Local Area Network (LAN), the platform
addresses the need for convenient and efficient communication in today's fast-paced
business environment.
FEASIBILITY ANALYSIS: An essential outcome of the preliminary investigation is
determining the feasibility of the system request. This entails evaluating operational,
economic, and technical feasibilities.
• Operational Feasibility: The system is designed to streamline administrative tasks and
enhance project progress tracking, thereby reducing time and energy previously expended
on manual processes. The operational feasibility study confirms the system's viability.
• Economic Feasibility: A cost-benefit analysis validates the economic justification for the
project. Leveraging existing hardware and network resources within the organization,
coupled with the network-based nature of the system allowing widespread usage, ensures
economic feasibility.
• Technical Feasibility: Assessment of technical resources reveals that the system can be
developed using IBM compatible machines with a graphical web browser connected to the
Internet and Intranet. Utilizing platform-independent technologies such as Java Server
Pages, JavaScript, HTML, SQL server, and WebLogic Server, the system is deemed
technically feasible for development with existing facilities.
1.2 EXISTING SYSTEM
The framework of secure Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) typically comprises two
modules: feature protection and feature similarity measurement. Feature protection involves
extracting image features and encrypting them using encryption techniques to ensure the
encrypted image feature descriptors can be utilized for retrieval calculation. Remote sensing
images often utilize traditional hand-crafted or deep network features to express visual
content. Deep learning networks, in particular, exhibit strong feature recognition
capabilities, making them suitable for remote sensing image retrieval due to their superiority
over hand-crafted features.
1.3 DISADVANTAGES OF EXISTING SYSTEM
Traditional key management schemes, often based on key trees or hierarchical structures,
rely heavily on the joining and leaving of members over time, leading to potential overheads.
Hierarchical structures, while offering convenient key management, introduce additional
intermediate entities (e.g., intermediate key managers), thereby increasing complexity and
overhead in the key management process.
1.4 PROPOSED SYSTEM
Despite the low computational complexity of existing works, encrypted features often retain
the original feature information, resulting in inadequate retrieval performance and
compromised security. To address these shortcomings, a secure image retrieval approach
based on homomorphic encryption is proposed.
1.5 ADVANTAGES OF PROPOSED SYSTEM
The proposed system addresses the vulnerabilities associated with Third-Party Auditors
(TPAs) by integrating blockchain technology for security verification. Unlike current
retrieval verification schemes, which overlook the correctness of retrieved results and
similarity rankings of returned images, the proposed system combines blockchain to enhance
security verification and ensure the integrity of retrieval results.
